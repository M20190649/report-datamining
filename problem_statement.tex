The main research question can be formulated as follows:

How accurately we can estimate a customer's position given
\begin{itemize}
    \item sequence of mobile network events generated by them (CDR data),
    \item cell tower data (cell map) to obtain location information for the connected cells.
\end{itemize}

Evaluating cellular network event based customer positioning boils down to defining and calculating a distance or (dis)similarity measure between point based trajectories.

More specifically, given a sequence of mobile network events $E = \langle e_{1}, e_{2}, .., e_{n} \mid n > 0 \rangle$ and a set of cell towers $C = \set{c_{1}, c_{2}, .., c_{m} \mid m > 0}$ we want to calculate $D(T,\Tilde{T})$, the distance of the real trajectory of events $T$ and the approximated trajectory $\Tilde{T}$.
