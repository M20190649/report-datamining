\subsection{Experimental setup}
The experiments were executed in a Mac Book Pro with the following characteristics: 2,6 GHz Intel Core i5, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 memory and 256 GB of storage.

\subsection{Analysis}
Data set coming from previous steps are used as an input for the calculations in the analysis. These are some of the most relevant features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item system\_time - timestamp of the recording
    \item cell\_loc - event's approximated location
    \item gps\_loc - event's GPS location, considered as ground truth
\end{itemize}

The analysis phase is executed with a following steps. For each date between 2018-03-12 and 2018-03-16 we do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Import input data from Parquet files
    \item Calculate Euclidean distance measure on trajectories
    \item Calculate edit distance distance measure on trajectories
\end{enumerate}

For the whole input data set we also do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Generate and display histograms on pairwise distances
    \item Calculate descriptive statistics on pairwise distances:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item min
            \item max
            \item sum
            \item mean
            \item standard deviation
        \end{itemize}
    \item Visualize on map
\end{enumerate}
